## Abstract

Dubbed as the new oil of our age, data has been univer-
sally recognized as the most important element in today's
economy. Yet the current global data economy is seriously

awed in a number of important aspects including privacy
concerns, data valuation, data accounting, data pricing and
data auditing. The solution to these long-neglected prob-
lems is to rigorously establish "data" as a new asset class and
invest research eort into the whole bundle of problems lying
at the intersection of data science and other domains which
we collectively put under the umbrella of "governance". In
this tutorial, we aim to introduce the notion of data as asset
and systematically examine various components and fron-
tiers in the scope of data asset governance, which includes
data ownership, data pricing, data trading and data audit-
ing. We would also illustrate the data economy ecosystem
in terms of how data 
ow among individual users, private
sectors and public sectors, zooming into two case studies |
(1) Personal data as emerging asset class; and (2) B-to-B
data sharing and exchange.
